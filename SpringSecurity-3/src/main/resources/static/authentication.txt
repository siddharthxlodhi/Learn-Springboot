1. Client Request
The process begins when a client sends a request to access a secured resource.

2. Security Filter Chain
Spring Security uses a chain of filters to process the request. The main filter is DelegatingFilterProxy, which delegates to FilterChainProxy.

3. Authentication Filter
The UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter intercepts the request and extracts the username and password.

4. Authentication Manager
The filter passes the credentials to the AuthenticationManager, which is responsible for authenticating the user.

5. Authentication Provider
The AuthenticationManager delegates the authentication to one or more AuthenticationProvider instances. Each provider performs specific authentication logic.

6. UserDetailsService
If the DaoAuthenticationProvider is used, it calls the UserDetailsService to load user details from a database or another source.

7. Password Encoding
The UserDetailsService returns a UserDetails object, and the AuthenticationProvider compares the provided password with the stored password using a PasswordEncoder.

8. Authentication Success
If the credentials are valid, the AuthenticationProvider returns an Authentication object, indicating a successful authentication.

9. Security Context
The SecurityContextHolder stores the Authentication object, making it available throughout the application.

10. Access Decision
The FilterSecurityInterceptor checks if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.

11. Response to Client
If the user is authorized, the request proceeds to the application, and the response is sent back to the client. If not, an access denied error is returned.
